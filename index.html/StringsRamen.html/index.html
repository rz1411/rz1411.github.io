  <p>Strings Ramen is an example of specialization done well. They do one thing and they don't cut corners. The noodles themselves are perhaps the best you can find in Madison, and I often find myself ordering an extra portion with my meal. The menu offers plenty of helpful information to help customers understand their order and learn more about ramen. Service is reliably fast, as well. Strings Ramen is good, but the price reflects that. Be prepared to spend more here for a meal than you would at other noodle spots. </p>
