  <p>Ramen Kid keeps it simple. The food is good, their tonkotsu broth is better than what you will find at many other spots in Madison. I find that the food often comes out not quite as hot as it could be. While that may not be a big deal for some people, I feel as if its a pretty important part of the meal, especially for a dish like ramen. Also, the pork portions feel a bit small. Overall, I think Ramen Kid offers good food, but there are things that could be improved. For the price, there are other options that could be considered.</p>
