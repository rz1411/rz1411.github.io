  <p>Hong Kong Station offers exceptional quality food. It is definitely worth stopping by to try out the create your own noodle soup option. The house-made spicy broth is superb and goes well with any combination of noodles and toppings, but I find that udon noodles with five-spice beef, mushrooms, and bok choy is my go-to order. The spicy broth is a perfect way to warm up on a cold day, and the location makes it a convenvient spot to get food after a badger football game. Be prepared to wait a while for food if it is particularly busy, though. </p>
